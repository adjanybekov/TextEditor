The goal OF This assignment was to learn Using Linked Lists, stacks , and Queues. 
I was responsible for implementing a functions for
ActionTypes History such as backspace, del, NewLine , Undo , Redo using indicated Data structures.
Moreover I analyzed possible crashes , performed testing for the
cases such creating putting the ActionType into the stack and then Pulling it back,
In correct order.
We Used doubly Linked lists Since it was easy to pick the elements from
Each character is A node and it has been connected to the next and previous character,
Each Line is a LinkedList that is saved in the Vector of LinkedLists.
